	* Making Downloads More Flexible in the SyncServer
		http://www.spasticmuffin.biz/blog/2017/09/15/making-downloads-more-flexible-in-the-syncserver/
		We are no longer going to discard all files if a failure occurs in the download. The local meta data is going to get updated with *every* download. We're moving to a more "eventual consistency" type of approach for downloads at least.
		
	* Removed various events, and replaced a SyncServerDelegate method. This is a breaking change relative to prior versions of the client interface.
	
	* Added more test cases for this eventual consistency change.
		
	* Add client call to cancel ongoing sync operation.
		E.g., this should be useful if downloads stall for some reason. 
	
	* Add tests for cancelling ongoing sync operation.
	
	* Removed unused properties on DownloadFileTracker objects due to these changes:
	     appMetaData, fileSizeBytes, localURL

Version 3.2.0; 9/9/17; 
	* Using version 2.1 of SyncServer-Shared-- to deal with NGNIX issue.

8/29/17	
	* Removed usage of update/creation dates from code internally.
	
	* Added new version (version 3) to Core Data model because of this.
		Lightweight migration on Core Data in order to remove update/creation dates from the upload tracker.
	
	* Fix bug with creation date where upload would crash
	
	* Added new client method to delete an array of files atomically.
		This required the addition of an undo manager to Core Data.
