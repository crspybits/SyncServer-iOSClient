// Each of these tests run in two parts, and have to be run manually. Or at least the second part has to be started up manually after the first part crashes.
// These tests must have the flag BACKGROUND_TASKS_TESTS set.

/*
I added code that runs when `BACKGROUND_TASKS_TESTS` is set for the simulator to work around the followin gissue. When I run the second test, I get a path that looks like this for the running app:

/Users/chris/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/F1714332-2FED-4F13-B6BD-B1209F6FA457/data/Containers/Data/Application/767A45D9-4B23-4058-A185-B58283E43909/Documents/

But the URL session result download was stored:
/Users/chris/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/F1714332-2FED-4F13-B6BD-B1209F6FA457/data/Containers/Data/Application/48D2714F-DED1-4B4F-B7CF-C1A61A8657E6/Library/Caches/com.apple.nsurlsessiond/Downloads/biz.SpasticMuffin.SyncServer/CFNetworkDownload_0Hnm5C.tmp

Notice that the path/UUID after `Application` differs!

I'm not sure if I'm going to run into this if I run on an actual device.
